# 🏥 Hospital Admission Risk Prediction

This project applies **machine learning** to predict hospital admission risk among patients with **heart failure**.  
It focuses on the role of **furosemide dose** and other clinical/demographic factors, with a strong emphasis on **interpretability** using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations).  

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict hospital admission risk.  
- **Key Features:** Furosemide dose, BMI, age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, alcohol, deprivation index.  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression and XGBoost with 5-fold cross-validation.  
- **Interpretability:** Odds Ratios, AUC and SHAP values to explain predictions for each patient.

## 📈 Results
- Higher **furosemide doses** were associated with increased admissions.  
- Other important predictors included **BMI, years since diagnosis, and comorbidities**.  
- SHAP provided **patient-level explanations** for risk predictions.
